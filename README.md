# UpTurn -> ReFlip

This is a project of mine to make a coin flip dApp on the skale network. 

ToDo:
    - Connect Firebase with address
        - total flips
            - seperate count for practice, real, maybe heads/tails
            - would like to show "{{totalFlips.heads}} heads and {{totalFlips.tails}} Tails" etc.
        - profit/loss
    - reflip.xyz
    - web app functionality (for mobile)
    - could leverage pi network
        - https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs
        - user auth
        - sign up pi users under me
    - coulda use SKALE
        - schedule meeting
        - would have to use ( and could get) real money
        - more complicated but better in long run
